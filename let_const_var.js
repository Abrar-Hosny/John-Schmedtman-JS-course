//let : - we useit if we know that this variable will change in the future
// const :- means that the variable will not change anytime
//here in const the varible must be intialized

//var :- variable that is like let but in old version 

//but we can use const better and if we really know that the variable will change the value
//of it se we can use let


let x = 21 ;

const y =23 ; 

var d =23 ; 


// we can also not use let or var or const like that 


language = 23 ;

//but this is bad idea
